# Predict-the-Salary

This project aims to predict salaries based on survey data using Python, Streamlit, and Linear Regression. The dataset used for this project is the "survey_2021.csv" obtained from Kaggle.

# 🌟 What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create web applications for machine learning and data science projects. It allows developers to quickly build interactive web apps using simple Python scripts, making it an ideal choice for showcasing data analysis and machine learning models.

# 📊 Understanding Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, Linear Regression is employed to predict salary based on various features such as education level, years of experience, job title, etc.


# 📊 The  Dataset
